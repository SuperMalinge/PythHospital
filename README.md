Artificial Hospital: A Python-based 2D Top-Down Healthcare Simulation

Artificial Hospital: A Python-based 2D Top-Down Healthcare Simulation‚Äù, is an innovative application that combines the engaging elements of a 2D top-down game with a simulated hospital environment.

The primary objective of this project is to create an artificial hospital where entities such as patients, nurses, and doctors interact in a 2D top-down view. Patients present with various symptoms, and doctors, equipped with a Large Language Model (LLM), diagnose these symptoms to identify potential illnesses.

The LLM serves as the core of the diagnostic process, learning from the interactions and improving its ability to identify illnesses accurately. The performance of the LLM is continuously evaluated based on its success rate in diagnosing illnesses correctly. This project aims to explore the effectiveness of LLMs in a healthcare setting and their potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics.
